# Github Declutter

Declutter your unused repo. Create your github personal access token, give permission for these scopes:

* repo => To access your repo
* delete_repo => To delete your repo

then declutter your repo.

## Why I create this?

I create my github account when I can't really code, but I have a ton of ideas. Each ideas, I will create a repo but that's only half-baked code. Now I want to make my github profile more professional-look that show case my capabilities, removing unused repo and not mix up decent repos with my broken repos. Hope this can also help you.

Well, at least I relief github from hundreds of megabytes of my trash code.
